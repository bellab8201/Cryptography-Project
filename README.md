## Cryptography Project

- len_ext_attack.py accepts an authorized API URL and modifys it to execute malicious code
- good.py and evil.py have identical MD5 hashes, but different SHA-256 hashes, example of generating hash collisions
- vigenere.py reads Vigenere ciphertext from stdin, and using a english word frequency comparison algorithm determines the key used to encrpyt
